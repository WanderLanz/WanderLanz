### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Bash Scripts for WSL2](https://github.com/WanderLanz/Wander-WSL2)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Bash Scripting, MIPS
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything I can contribute to without ruining.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [Wander-WSL2](https://github.com/WanderLanz/Wander-WSL2)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want, I probably don't know.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm way too casual

I've dabbled in C/C++, Haskell, and Scala in school (I'm not one of those crazy teenage full-stack devs)
